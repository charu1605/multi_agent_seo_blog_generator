# Blog Post

Write a detailed blog post on the following outline:
{'Introduction': 'An introduction to HR Trends.', 'Main Points': ['Key aspect 1 of HR Trends.', 'Key aspect 2 of HR Trends.', 'Key aspect 3 of HR Trends.'], 'Conclusion': 'Summarizing the importance of HR Trends.'}

We'll go **ahead** and take a look at some of the issues I've already discussed. I know, I know; but I'm going to start with some of the key topics on which I feel like this article needs further elaboration.

Key issues The following three areas do not get very much attention:

Problem 1: How to be pro**act**ive

The key to doing good is to **act** before an employee is going to do anything. You see, I know my HR office doesn't have a lot of help, so a big part of this blog post will focus on solving problems with our HR team.

The key to doing good is to **act** before an employee is going to do anything. You see, I can go and work right outside my office, but that doesn't mean I can't talk to my HR folks if necessary. The key to doing good is to **act** on behalf of our team.

For example, at last year's EMEA I was told to "sit close to your manager," because "no one is doing that." We had two internal team meetings where employees needed to "sit far away from his office." He's one of the few people who **act**ually walks the walk to the end of our line, not even as close as a colleague who has a job to do on our team. That is an issue that many HR managers are unable to deal with.

Here's what makes this problem even more problematic: We don't have a whole lot of **accountability** for employees who are doing stupid wrong things, such as stealing coffee. I do not deny that employees might be tempted to steal a free coffee. The problem is that you can't.

The problem isn't going away, either, and no company in the world needs to rely so heavily on your staff being good. For those of us who are not working for any one company at a time, what we need to focus on is the role of the person who has **act**ually done what is important to us. For this reason, I'll leave aside many of the obvious problems that often plague HR. (A couple of them are related to our culture, which encourages good behavior: a great deal of good code gets done at work, etc.) What matters, in particular, is the "sign up" time where employees can show what they're interested in doing: this time, they are talking about what they want to do, not just what they want said to be on the team.

This post is dedicated solely to tackling the first two issues in our culture. As I've said before, most HR staff understand that many people are going to leave a great experience and work for the best company they work for so they leave, often just because they want to, or simply because they are passionate about their career (for instance, someone will leave because they love a project and feel that they need to "work on their own"). This creates a sense of trust, in many ways, for people who are leaving because it feels like they need to do the right thing for the company and the long-term value of the project. If no other solution they choose is the best one to have for their project, they are going to have trouble taking their time. But if there is one method to solve your HR problem, it's to follow the recommendations of their own team and **act**. It's probably not going to be as simple as sitting down with your friends and coworkers and looking at their resume for ideas for your next plan.

Key issues

The following two issues will get even more attention here:

Key areas of concern for HR The following three elements of this article are just a quick outline of the key areas that I really don't want your team to be worried about. These areas are for people who are not interested in doing things right. If you don't care about working for a great company, there is **absolutely** no point in going to this website or anything, unless you're willing (and willing to pay) to step into the shoes of a bad employee. Why? It's because the company you are working for is going to be a better place than it was before. If you don't care about your team, you're going to have to do something different. We all know that there's going to be big, messy turnover at your company, so why should you think of the company as an even worse place in the long run? This is an issue, for most companies, in which you are just wasting your time trying to put in the effort needed
